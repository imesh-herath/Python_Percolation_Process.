# Python_Percolation_Process.
A two-digit randomized numbers will create dynamic grid. The grid will contain empty slots without numbers 
which will be randomly generated again. This program will be able to check each column for feasible percolation. 
If containing one or more empty spaces from top to bottom within a column, then percolation to be feasible a 
column should consist numbers from top to bottom. It is must for the grid to be populated automatically with two digit random numbers. And there will be empty cells which seem to be appearing randomly inside the grid. Then 
this program displays the status at the end of each column display ‘OK’ if percolation is feasible. Else it will 
display ‘NO’. In this program I have used the tabulate module for time creation of boarders around the numbers 
to bring out the grid appearance. Then the final output answer must be written to a text file so that the result can 
be viewed later via notepad.

Eg:
  3x3 (Multiple sign should be "x". not "*")
